# Customer Churn Predictor

The idea is to develop a predictive model that accurately identifies customers who are likely to churn in the near future. By using historical data, the model aims to help the telecommunications company proactively retain at-risk customers through targeted interventions and personalized offers.

I will be leveraging the widely used CRISP-DM Framework for this project.

The CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework is a widely used methodology for data mining and data analysis projects. It provides a structured approach for planning and executing data projects. The process is cyclic and iterative, consisting of six phases:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment
